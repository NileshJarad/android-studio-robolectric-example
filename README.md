## Android Studio Build Variants + Robolectric Test Example
--- 
This example project shows how to use robolectric, junit and assertJ with your gradle-based Android Studio projects. Specifically, this shows how to test different *build configurations*, and *product flavors*.

This is a fork of [Josh Skeen's Roboelectric Demo](https://github.com/mutexkid/android-studio-robolectric-example) which focuses on setting up Android Studio and Robolectric. If you haven't explored that repo first, I suggest you read through the readme.


More information about this repository is detailed in a [blog post](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/testing-android-product-flavors-with-robolectric/).
